##Visual Style 1

The first style I choose was a futuristic smooth style with organized layout and gradients. I wanted to create an engaging layout with a lot of visual support. I wanted to use a sans serif font in combination with a script font to create a welcoming feel.

The advatages of this layout is to create a visually appealing experience for the user. The disadvate of the colorful layout is that it might be distracting or draw away from the content.

Visual style 2 was intended to be more fun with a focus on content for student use. the direction of this style was made with education in mind. A fun engaging layout with flat icons and buttons familia with the apple and other media button designs.

The style of this layout is a simple retro style with fuction and navigation being the most important aspect. There are few colours in the layout and the focs is on the content. Hopefully the layout is simple enough to be functional while still being designed enough to look good.
