Plant Sterols 101

Plant sterols help lower your cholesterol

Coronary heart disease is the number one cause of death around the world. High blood levels of the “bad” or LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol can create a buildup of plaque (cholesterol deposits) inside the arteries. This can lead to narrowing of the arteries and a higher risk of having a heart attack or stroke. The good news is that following a heart healthy lifestyle, including a heart healthy diet, can help you control your cholesterol levels and lower your overall risk of heart disease.
