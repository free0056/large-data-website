Hurler's syndrome has a frequency of one in 100,000 live births in Australia and sufferers develop severe mental and physical disabilities and often die in their early teens.
The disease is caused by a single defective enzyme that is essential for breaking down complex sugars in cells.
The researchers are modifying adult stem cells to make them produce large amounts of the deficient enzyme, and using them to replace cells which aren't functioning properly throughout the body. Preliminary results in laboratory studies are showing improvements in brain function.
"We have turned adult stem cells into little 'enzyme factories' by coupling them with a virus that makes them pump out high levels of the enzyme," says PhD candidate Matilda Jackson from the University's School of Molecular and Biomedical Sciences.
