# The topic I have chosen to do is Genes, and the Human Genome.


This is a topic that I have always found interesting and I am excited to have an opportunity to learn about the differences and commonalities we share with our species through or genes and what genes play a roll in making us who we are.

The purpose of this project to properly illustrate and organize a lot of material into a well organizes site. I hope to learn about How our genes make us special or not so special and what makes us humans.
